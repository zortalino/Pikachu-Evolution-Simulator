# Pikachu-Evolution-Simulator
Train and Battle your Pikachu in order to level it up!
The pokemon will start at level 0
User will be given 4 options: Display(1), Train(2), Battle(3), Quit(4).
They will input the coreponding number (ie. to Display, input 1) to do said action
Display will allow a trainer to see the current name of pokemon, a picture, and its current level
Train: increases pokemon level by 1
Gym Battle: increases pokemon level by 2
Exit: Exits the program
Progress will not be saved after exiting.

I was unable to input the ability to pick from a select amount of starters which I hope to include in future inputs
